Integrated-C
============

some programs I made for the Roborugby module in UCD Engineering using BotBall and integrated C

Roborugby Cup UCD 2011 Code for botball robot
Out teams name was Skynet , we did alright until our robots sensors went beserk in one of the final rounds

Hope the code helps with understanding the Botball integrated C
